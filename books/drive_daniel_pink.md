# Drive - Daniel H. Pink

## Introduction

> Scientists then knew that two main drives powered behavior. The first was the biological drive. (...) But the only other known drive also failed to explain the monkeys’ peculiar behavior. If biological motivations came from within, this second drive came from without—the rewards and punishments the environment delivered for behaving in certain ways.

> “The behavior obtained in this investigation poses some interesting questions for motivation theory, since significant learning was attained and efficient performance maintained without resort to special or extrinsic incentives.”
