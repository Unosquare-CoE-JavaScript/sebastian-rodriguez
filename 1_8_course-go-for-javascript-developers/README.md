# Go for Javacsript Developers

## Go History

Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.

## Go Features

It provides a rich standard library, garbage collection, and dynamic-typing capability. It is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.

- Lightweight type system
- Concurrency
- Automatic garbage collection
- Strict dependencies
- Convention

## Go Motivation

Combine:

- Fast compile times
- Ease of development
- Fast execution
- Reduces complexity of C
- Wicked fast build time

## Go vs. Javascript

- Typing
  - GO: Strongly typed
    - String, Float, Int, Byte, Struct...
  - JS: Dynamically typed
    - Think: Typescript
- Structures
  - GO: Structs, Pointers, Methods, Interfaces
    - Define behavior and attributes
  - JS: ES6 Classes (kind of)
    - Define behavior and attributes
- Error Handling:
  - GO: Explicit
    - Sad path won't handle itself
  - JS: Build in
    - You'll get yalled at regardless
- Multi-tasking
  - GO: Multi-Threaded
    - Concurrency, Goroutines, Sync
  - JS: Single-Threaded
    - Callbacks, async await, sagas, sadness
- Opinionated-ness
  - GO: Strong opinions
    - Convention, build in tooling and linters
  - JS: Fluid Opinions
    - Subjective to the mood that day
