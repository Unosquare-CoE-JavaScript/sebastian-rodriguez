# The Manager's Path - Camille Fournier

## Introduction

> “In my experience, most of the challenge of engineering management is in the intersection of “engineering” and “management.” The people side is hard, and I don’t want to sell the challenges of those interpersonal relationships short. But those people-specific management skills also translate across industries and jobs. If you are interested in improving on purely the people management side of leadership, books like First, Break All the Rules1 are excellent references.”

> “What engineering managers do, though, is not pure people management. We are managing groups of technical people, and most of us come into the role from a position of hands-on expertise. I wouldn’t recommend trying to do it any other way! Hands-on expertise is what gives you credibility and what helps you make decisions and lead your team effectively. ”
