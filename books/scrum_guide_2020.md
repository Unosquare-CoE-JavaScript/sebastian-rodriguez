## Definition

Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.

In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:

1. A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
4. Repeat

The Scrum framework is purposefully incomplete, only defining the parts required to implement Scrum theory. Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it. Rather than provide people with detailed instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships and interactions.

## Theory

Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials.

Scrum combines four formal events for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint. These events work because they implement the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

### TRANSPARENCY

The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work. With Scrum, important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal artifacts. Artifacts that have low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk.

Transparency enables inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.

### INSPECTION

The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems. To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five events.

Inspection enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. **Scrum events are designed to provoke change.**

### ADAPTATION

If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted. **The adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.**

**Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing.** A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.

## Values

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values:

**Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage**

The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges. Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work. The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.

These values give direction to the Scrum Team with regard to their work, actions, and behavior. The Scrum Team members learn and explore the values as they work with the Scrum events and artifacts.

## Team

The fundamental unit of Scrum is a small team of people, a Scrum Team. The Scrum Team consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers. Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal.  They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how.

The Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people (that smaller teams communicate better and are more productive).

If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. Therefore, they should share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner.

### DEVELOPERS

Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.

### PRODUCT OWNER

The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team.

The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management, which includes:

- Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;
- Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;
- Ordering Product Backlog items; and,
- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.

The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable.

**For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions.**

The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.

### SCRUM MASTER

The Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization. The Scrum Master is accountable for the Scrum Team’s effectiveness.

## Events

**The Sprint is a container for all other events.** Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts. These events are specifically designed to enable the transparency required. Failure to operate any events as prescribed results in lost opportunities to inspect and adapt. Events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.

### THE SPRINT

Sprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, where ideas are turned into value.

They are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints.

**Each Sprint may be considered a short project.**

**A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint.**

### SPRINT PLANNING

Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.

Sprint Planning addresses the following topics:

- **Topic One: Why is this Sprint valuable?:** The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint.
- **Topic Two: What can be Done this Sprint?:** Through discussion with the Product Owner, the Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint.
- **Topic Three: How will the chosen work get done?:** For each selected Product Backlog item, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done. **This is often done by decomposing Product Backlog items into smaller work items of one day or less.**

\* *Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.*

### DAILY SCRUM

The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.

**Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings.**

\* *The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team.*

### SPRINT REVIEW

The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.

\* *The Sprint Review is the second to last event of the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.*

### SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.

**The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint.**

\* *It is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.*

## Artifacts

**Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value.** They are designed to maximize transparency of key information. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation.

### PRODUCT BACKLOG

The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.

Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size.

#### COMMITMENT: PRODUCT GOAL

The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog. The rest of the Product Backlog emerges to define “what” will fulfill the Product Goal.

### SPRINT BACKLOG

The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how).

The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers. It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal.

#### COMMITMENT: SPRINT GOAL

**The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint.** Although the Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Developers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it.

**The Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Sprint Backlog.**

### INCREMENT

An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable.

**The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value and work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done.**

#### COMMITMENT: DEFINITION OF DONE

The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product.

**The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born. If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done, it cannot be released or even presented at the Sprint Review. Instead, it returns to the Product Backlog for future consideration.**

If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product.

The Developers are required to conform to the Definition of Done. If there are multiple Scrum Teams working together on a product, they must mutually define and comply with the same Definition of Done.

## End Note

Scrum is free and offered in this Guide. The Scrum framework, as outlined herein, is immutable. While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum. Scrum exists only in its entirety and functions well as a container for other techniques, methodologies, and practices.
