# Drive - Daniel H. Pink

## Introduction

> Scientists then knew that two main drives powered behavior. The first was the biological drive. (...) But the only other known drive also failed to explain the monkeys’ peculiar behavior. If biological motivations came from within, this second drive came from without—the rewards and punishments the environment delivered for behaving in certain ways.

> “The behavior obtained in this investigation poses some interesting questions for motivation theory, since significant learning was attained and efficient performance maintained without resort to special or extrinsic incentives.”
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (p. 3). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

> Harlow offered a novel theory—what amounted to a third drive: “The performance of the task,” he said, “provided intrinsic reward.” The monkeys solved the puzzles simply because they found it gratifying to solve puzzles. They enjoyed it. The joy of the task was its own reward. (...) Perhaps this newly discovered drive—Harlow eventually called it “intrinsic motivation”—was real. But surely it was subordinate to the other two drives.

>“When money is used as an external reward for some activity, the subjects lose intrinsic interest for the activity,” he wrote. Rewards can deliver a short-term boost—just as a jolt of caffeine can keep you cranking for a few more hours. But the effect wears off—and, worse, can reduce a person’s longer-term motivation to continue the project.

> Human beings, Deci said, have an “inherent tendency to seek out novelty and challenges, to extend and exercise their capacities, to explore, and to learn.” But this third drive was more fragile than the other two; it needed the right environment to survive. “One who is interested in developing and enhancing intrinsic motivation in children, employees, students, etc., should not concentrate on external-control systems such as monetary rewards”

## Part One. A new Operating System

### Chapter 1. The Rise and Fall of Motivation 2.0

> In our very early days—I mean very early days, say, fifty thousand years ago—the underlying assumption about human behavior was simple and true. We were trying to survive. From roaming the savannah to gather food to scrambling for the bushes when a saber-toothed tiger approached, that drive guided most of our behavior. Call this early operating system Motivation 1.0. (...) **It worked well. Until it didn’t.**
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (p. 16). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

> Humans are more than the sum of our biological urges. That first drive still mattered—no doubt about that—but it didn’t fully account for who we are. We also had a second drive—to seek reward and avoid punishment more broadly. And it was from this insight that a new operating system—call it Motivation 2.0—arose. (...) But what this operating system lacked in enlightenment, it made up for in effectiveness. **It worked well—extremely well. Until it didn’t.**
>

> For as long as any of us can remember, we’ve configured our organizations and constructed our lives around its bedrock assumption: The way to improve performance, increase productivity, and encourage excellence is to reward the good and punish the bad.
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (pp. 17-18). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

> As the twentieth century progressed, as economies grew still more complex, and as the people in them had to deploy new, more sophisticated skills, the Motivation 2.0 approach encountered some resistance.
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (p. 18). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

> Frederick Herzberg, a psychologist-turned-management professor, proposed that two key factors determined how people fared on the job. The first were “hygiene” factors—extrinsic rewards such as pay, working conditions, and job security. Their absence created dissatisfaction, but their presence didn’t lead to job satisfaction. The second were “motivators”—things like enjoyment of the work itself, genuine achievement, and personal growth. These internal desires were what really boosted both satisfaction and performance and were where managers ought to focus their attention.

#### THREE INCOMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS

> Motivation 2.0 still serves some purposes well. It’s just deeply unreliable. Sometimes it works; many times it doesn’t. And understanding its defects will help determine which parts to keep and which to discard as we fashion an upgrade. The glitches fall into three broad categories. Our current operating system has become far less compatible with, and at times downright antagonistic to: how we organize what we do; how we think about what we do; and how we do what we do.
>

##### How We Organize What We Do

> Wikipedia represents the most powerful new business model of the twenty-first century: open source.
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (p. 20). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

> (...) companies that typically rely on external rewards to manage their employees run some of their most important systems with products created by nonemployees who don’t seem to need such rewards.
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (p. 21). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

> But ultimately, open source depends on intrinsic motivation with the same ferocity that older business models rely on extrinsic motivation, as several scholars have shown.
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (p. 21). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

> Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus has begun creating what he calls “social businesses.” These are companies that raise capital, develop products, and sell them in an open market but do so in the service of a larger social mission—or as he puts it, “with the profit-maximization principle replaced by the social-benefit principle.”
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (p. 23). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

> One reason could be that traditional businesses are profit maximizers, which square perfectly with Motivation 2.0. These new entities are purpose maximizers—which are unsuited to this older operating system because they flout its very principles.
>

##### How We Think About What We Do

> Economics, she explained, wasn’t the study of money. It was the study of behavior. In the course of a day, each of us was constantly figuring the cost and benefits of our actions and then deciding how to act. Economists studied what people did, rather than what we said, because we did what was best for us. We were rational calculators of our economic self-interest.
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (p. 24). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

But...

> Kahneman and others in the field of behavioral economics agreed with my professor that economics was the study of human economic behavior. They just believed that we’d placed too much emphasis on the economic and not enough on the human. That hyperrational calculator-brained person wasn’t real. He was a convenient fiction.
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (p. 25). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

So,

> In real life our behavior is far more complex than the textbook allows and often confounds the idea that we’re purely rational. (…) In short, we are irrational—and predictably so, says economist Dan Ariely, author of Predictably Irrational, a book that offers an entertaining and engaging overview of behavioral economics.

> Indeed, the very premise of extrinsic incentives is that we’ll always respond rationally to them. But even most economists don’t believe that anymore. Sometimes these motivators work. Often they don’t. And many times, they inflict collateral damage. In short, the new way economists think about what we do is hard to reconcile with Motivation 2.0.

> “Intrinsic motivation is of great importance for all economic activities. It is inconceivable that people are motivated solely or even mainly by external incentives.”

##### How We Do What We Do

> Begin with complexity. Behavioral scientists often divide what we do on the job or learn in school into two categories: “algorithmic” and “heuristic.” An algorithmic task is one in which you follow a set of established instructions down a single pathway to one conclusion. That is, there’s an algorithm for solving it. A heuristic task is the opposite. Precisely because no algorithm exists for it, you have to experiment with possibilities and devise a novel solution.

> Just as oxen and then forklifts replaced simple physical labor, computers are replacing simple intellectual labor.

> The consulting firm McKinsey & Co. estimates that in the United States, only 30 percent of job growth now comes from algorithmic work, while 70 percent comes from heuristic work.9 A key reason: Routine work can be outsourced or automated; artistic, empathic, nonroutine work generally cannot.
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (p. 28). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

> The implications for motivation are vast. Researchers such as Harvard Business School’s Teresa Amabile have found that external rewards and punishments—both carrots and sticks—can work nicely for algorithmic tasks. But they can be devastating for heuristic ones.
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (pp. 28-29). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

> “Intrinsic motivation is conducive to creativity; controlling extrinsic motivation is detrimental to creativity.” In other words, the central tenets of Motivation 2.0 may actually impair performance of the heuristic, right-brain work on which modern economies depend.
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (p. 29). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

> Partly because work has become more creative and less routine, it has also become more enjoyable. That, too, scrambles Motivation 2.0’s assumptions. This operating system rests on the belief that work is not inherently enjoyable—which is precisely why we must coax people with external rewards and threaten them with outside punishment.
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (p. 29). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

> Routine, not-so-interesting jobs require direction; nonroutine, more interesting work depends on self-direction. One business leader, who didn’t want to be identified, said it plainly. When he conducts job interviews, he tells prospective employees: “If you need me to motivate you, I probably don’t want to hire you.”
>
> TO RECAP, Motivation 2.0 suffers from three compatibility problems. It doesn’t mesh with the way many new business models are organizing what we do—because we’re intrinsically motivated purpose maximizers, not only extrinsically motivated profit maximizers.

### Chapter 2. Seven Reason Carrots and Sticks (Often) Don't Work…

> Motivation 2.0 is similar. At its heart are two elegant and simple ideas: 
>
> _Rewarding an activity will get you more of it. Punishing an activity will get you less of it._
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (p. 32). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

> Of course, the starting point for any discussion of motivation in the workplace is a simple fact of life: People have to earn a living. Salary, contract payments, some benefits, a few perks are what I call “baseline rewards.” If someone’s baseline rewards aren’t adequate or equitable, her focus will be on the unfairness of her situation and the anxiety of her circumstance. You’ll get neither the predictability of extrinsic motivation nor the weirdness of intrinsic motivation. You’ll get very little motivation at all. **The best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table.**
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (p. 33). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

#### Less Of What We Want

> “that Work consists of whatever a body is OBLIGED to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do.”
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (p. 34). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

> There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and then they would resign.
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (pp. 34-35). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

> In other words, rewards can perform a weird sort of behavioral alchemy: They can transform an interesting task into a drudge. They can turn play into work. And by diminishing intrinsic motivation, they can send performance, creativity, and even upstanding behavior toppling like dominoes. Let’s call this the Sawyer Effect.a
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (p. 35). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

##### Intrinsic Motivation

> (...) they referred to the counterintuitive consequences of extrinsic incentives as “the hidden costs of rewards.”
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (p. 35). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

> To be clear, it wasn’t necessarily the rewards themselves that dampened the children’s interest. Remember: When children didn’t expect a reward, receiving one had little impact on their intrinsic motivation. Only contingent rewards—if you do this, then you’ll get that—had the negative effect. Why? “If-then” rewards require people to forfeit some of their autonomy. Like the gentlemen driving carriages for money instead of fun, they’re no longer fully controlling their lives. And that can spring a hole in the bottom of their motivational bucket, draining an activity of its enjoyment.
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (p. 36). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

> “Careful consideration of reward effects reported in 128 experiments lead to the conclusion that tangible rewards tend to have a substantially negative effect on intrinsic motivation,” they determined. “When institutions—families, schools, businesses, and athletic teams, for example—focus on the short-term and opt for controlling people’s behavior,” they do considerable long-term damage.
>
> - Pink, Daniel H.. Drive (p. 37). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

> “People use rewards expecting to gain the benefit of increasing another person’s motivation and behavior, but in so doing, they often incur the unintentional and hidden cost of undermining that person’s intrinsic motivation toward the activity.”
